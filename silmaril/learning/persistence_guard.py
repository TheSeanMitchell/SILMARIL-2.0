silmaril.learning.persistence_guard — Protects learning state from wipes.

ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE:
    Learning is sacred. No workflow — daily, backtest, reset, or otherwise —
    is permitted to delete or overwrite any file in PROTECTED_LEARNING_FILES
    without going through this module's `safe_reset()` function, which by
    design preserves all learning artifacts.

This is the single source of truth for what counts as "agent training memory."
Every reset workflow MUST import from here. The reset.yml workflow checks
this list and explicitly skips these files.

Usage:
    from silmaril.learning.persistence_guard import (
        PROTECTED_LEARNING_FILES, is_protected, safe_reset, backup_learning_state
    )
