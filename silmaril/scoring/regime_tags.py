"""
silmaril.scoring.regime_tags — Market-condition labels attached to every
decision so we can later answer questions like:

  "Does FORGE only work in trending markets?"
  "Does HEX make money in ranging markets but lose in trends?"
  "Does VEIL fire well only when there's news?"

Without these labels, performance numbers are noise. With them, you can
detect regime-specific edge and downweight agents outside their comfort zone.

Tags applied at decision time (snapshot of the world):
  market_regime:       RISK_ON | NEUTRAL | RISK_OFF        (from VIX + breadth)
  trend_state:         TRENDING | RANGING | UNCLEAR        (from SMA stack + slope)
  vol_state:           HIGH_VOL | NORMAL | LOW_VOL          (from ATR/price ratio)
  news_state:          POSITIVE_NEWS | NEGATIVE_NEWS | NORMAL  (from sentiment)
  liquidity_state:     LIQUID | THIN                        (from volume)
