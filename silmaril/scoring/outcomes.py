"""
silmaril.scoring.outcomes — Score yesterday's predictions against today's prices.

The learning loop:

  Day N:    agents vote, debate resolves, positions open
  Day N+1:  we look at what happened to each ticker overnight
            and score every BUY / SELL / HOLD vote on that ticker

A BUY is "right" if the price went up by more than fees.
A SELL is "right" if the price went down.
A HOLD is "right" if the price moved by less than half an ATR.
An ABSTAIN is never scored — silence is not a prediction.

Agent score is the running track record across all closed predictions.
This lets us answer:
  "What is FORGE's win rate in trending markets?"
  "What is THUNDERHEAD's expected value when conviction > 0.7?"
  "Which agent has the worst max drawdown of conviction-weighted returns?"

Runs at the start of every CLI cycle, before today's debate. Persisted
to scoring.json so the Truth Dashboard can read it without recomputing.

--- ALPHA 2.0 PATCH NOTES ---

Bug fixed: prior-run date comparison was comparing a full ISO timestamp
string (e.g. "2026-04-30T20:26:33+00:00") against a YYYY-MM-DD date string
(e.g. "2026-04-30"). These never matched, so prior_run was always resolved
to the most recent run in history — which was today's own run — and every
ticker was scored against its own prices (entry == exit, 0% return,
all directional calls marked wrong). This cascaded into:

  - All agents trending toward 0% win rate
  - Weight multipliers dropping below 0.85x kill threshold
  - Mass agent freezes (THUNDERHEAD, VEIL, KESTREL, ZENITH, WEAVER, HEX, SYNTH)
  - Cohort avg return corrupted → safe_mode triggered
  - Evolution cards never populated (no valid scored outcomes)

Fix: normalize date to YYYY-MM-DD via [:10] before comparison.
Stale-price guard added: if entry == exit after a clean cross-day lookup,
the outcome is logged as a warning and still recorded (real price may be
genuinely flat) but flagged with stale_price_suspected=True for diagnostics.

--- ALPHA 7.0 PATCH NOTES (clean-evidence gate) ---

The stale_price_suspected flag above was diagnostic only — stale outcomes
still flowed into win rate, EV and the kill-switch weight. With ~89% of the
corpus stale, this meant:
  - HOLD-on-stale (0.0% move within tolerance) scored "correct" → do-nothing
    agents posted fake ~100% win rates and were boosted/protected;
  - BUY/SELL-on-stale (0.0% move) scored "wrong" → agents that actually took
    positions were penalised and frozen.
The loop was selecting for inaction.

Fix: build_scoring_summary() now computes win rate, EV, max drawdown, the
per-regime cuts and the kill-switch weight over CLEAN (non-stale) outcomes
only. Agents with zero clean outcomes get a neutral 1.0 weight and a
win_rate of None (not a fake 100%). Each leaderboard row now carries
clean_calls + evidence ("clean" | "thin" | "stale_only" | "none"); the
summary carries total_clean_calls + agents_with_clean_evidence; best/worst
agents are chosen from clean-evidence agents only. Raw outcomes (with their
stale flags) are persisted unchanged. Companion fix in
silmaril/senate/elections.py applies the same stale exclusion to the
rolling-win-rate that drives promote/demote/kill.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Regime-aware weight (Alpha 2.1.5 — added 2026-05-04)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS:
# The global _compute_weight_multiplier() above blends ALL of an agent's
# calls into one win rate. That creates a false-negative on specialists.
#
# Example: BARON is +65% win rate in RISK_ON regimes (his expertise) but
# -35% win rate in RISK_OFF regimes (where he votes anyway, badly). His
# global win rate averages out to ~50%, EV slightly negative, multiplier
# drops to 0.78×, the kill switch in engine.py freezes him. He gets
# capital-frozen even though he's actually a great RISK_ON specialist.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
# Looks at the agent's per-regime breakdown. If ANY single regime bucket
# has 10+ calls and a strong multiplier (≥1.0), the agent's "kill-switch
# weight" becomes the MAX of (global, best-regime). Specialists don't get
# killed for being bad outside their specialty — they get to keep voting
# (Thompson handles that already) AND keep their capital authority.
#
# WHAT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE:
# - Thompson sampling still works per-regime via the Beta posteriors
#   (thompson_arbiter.py is untouched)
# - The global weight is still computed and exposed for diagnostics
# - Agents with no clear regime expertise still get the global weight
#
# WHAT THE DASHBOARD GETS NEW:
#   row["regime_aware_weight"]      — float in [0.5, 1.5] (this is what the
#                                      kill switch will read going forward)
#   row["global_weight"]            — float, the old global multiplier
#                                      (kept for transparency)
#   row["best_regime"]              — {dimension, label, n, win_rate, ev,
#                                      multiplier} or None
