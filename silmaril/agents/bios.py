silmaril.agents.bios — Rich biographical profiles for every agent.

These bios are the long-form explanation of each agent's:
  • Trading style and strategy
  • Temperament and personality
  • Universe of what they'll evaluate
  • Strengths and failure modes
  • How to read their votes

Surfaced in the agent roster drawer on the dashboard. Keeping them in
one file rather than on each agent class makes them easy to edit and
keeps the agent files focused on logic.
